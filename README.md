# RestAssuredTest
This a sample basic rest assured project which I have learned with the help of one youtube channel.
Some basic Rest Assured programs that are covered are:
1) How to call basic requests such as GET, POST, PUT and Delete
2) Advanced Post request calling methods using Hashmap, Post request body creation by using org.jsonfile, by using POJO classes and by using external JSON file
3) Some general validations for cookies, Headers, logging and Path, Query parameters.
4) JSON requests parsing techniques.
